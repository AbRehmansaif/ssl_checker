## 🚀 Getting Started with the Project
## Clone the Repository:

Linux and macOS:

```bash
sudo git clone https://github.com/AbRehmansaif/ssl_checker.git
```

Windows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbRehmansaif/ssl_checker.git
```

To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. It's advised you create a virtual environment to store your projects dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

## Set up a Python Virtual Environment:
Windows:
```
python -m venv env
```
Linux and macOS:
```
python3 -m venv env
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment:
That will create a new folder `env` in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on Win/linux:

Window (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
```
env\Scripts\activate
```
Linux and macOS:
```
source env/bin/active
```
## Deactivate the Virtual Environment:`env`
```
deactivate
```
## Install Project Dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Create and Apply Database Migrations:
**Step 1: Create Migration Files for Models:**
```
python manage.py makemigrations
```

**Step 2: Apply Migrations to Update the Database Schema:**
```
python manage.py migrate
```

## Run the Project:
**Default Port (8000):**
```
python manage.py runserver
```
**Custom Port:**
To run the project on a custom port, e.g., `9000`:

```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9000
```

## Notes:
- Ensure Python is installed and added to your PATH.
- Use python3 explicitly on Linux if python defaults to Python 2.
- To confirm, after activation, you can check the Python interpreter being used:
```
python --version
```

OR

```
which python
```
